Brain tumor segmentation from medical images is a critical task that aids in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. In this thesis, we present a novel approach that leverages a U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms to achieve high accuracy in brain tumor segmentation while minimizing the required dataset size. Our method introduces a streamlined data processing pipeline that employs advanced attention blocks to focus on relevant features and improve segmentation performance. We conduct extensive experiments using standard brain tumor imaging datasets, comparing our approach against baseline U-Net models and other state-of-the-art techniques. Our results demonstrate that the attention-enhanced U-Net achieves superior accuracy with a significantly reduced dataset size, outperforming traditional models in terms of segmentation quality and computational efficiency. By optimizing the model's architecture and employing efficient training techniques, we successfully reduce the model's dependency on large datasets while preserving its performance. This work contributes to the advancement of medical image analysis by offering a data-efficient solution for brain tumor segmentation that can be adapted for practical clinical use. Our findings have potential implications for medical research and clinical practice, providing a foundation for future studies that seek to enhance medical imaging tasks using compact datasets and attention-driven neural network models.
